### 2. Basic typography rules:
**Fonts:**
1. Choose the right font. Consider which screen would user typically read your text on, and what is appropriate font for your message.
1. Take your time. Quality typesetting requires lots of patience
1. Limit the number of fonts used. Dont use more than 3 fonts.
1. Pairing fonts - pick ones with similar letter sizes and heights. Dont pair fonts that are too similar to each other.
1. Make sure you have proper fonts for all the flavours of type you need. If You dont, browser will create bold and italic font without Your control
1. If choose popular typeface, try pairing it with a less used typeface to make the design feel distinctive.

**Formatting**: 
1. Text alignment - probably choose left. Its most common and easy to read.
1. Space between letters - sometimes needs to be tightened or loosened. In CSS: `letter-spacing`
1. Line height (leading) - a value should be 1.25 to 1.5 times greater than the font size. In CSS: `line-height`
1. Line lenght - if the Line lenght is long, the line height should be increased, and vice versa. For a single column design, many designers believe 65 characters is the perfect line lenght.
1. Hierarchy - different weights, styles, and sizes of fonts help to direct readers attention. Make use of your h1, h2, and h3 styles for headings and subsections within posts
1. Lines need minimum and maximum lengths

**Other:**
1. Style guide - make one at the beginning of the project for consistency purposes.
1. Test. Make sure to test how the fonts look on different platforms.
1. Check the performance of font loading. Optimizing it may benefit a lot.
