**Typeface** - all type of a single design. Also known as font-family.

#### Basic typography concerns:
1. **Pairing fonts** - pick ones with similar letter sizes and heights.
1. **Line height** - a general rule is that the value should be 1.25 to 1.5 times greater than the font size.
1. **Amount of space between letters** - sometimes needs to be tightened or loosened.
1. **Line lenght** - if the Line lenght is long, the line height should be increased, and vice versa. For a single column design, many designers believe 65 characters is the perfect line lenght.
1. **Hierarchy** - with different weights, styles, and sizes of fonts helps to create a flow of importance for your readers.

#### Basic typography rules:
1. Choose the right font. Consider which screen would user typically read your text on.
1. Limit the number of fonts used. Look within the same font family.
1. Text alignment- probably choose left. Its most common and easy to read.
1. Follow hierarchy. Make use of your h1, h2, and h3 styles for headings and subsections within posts
