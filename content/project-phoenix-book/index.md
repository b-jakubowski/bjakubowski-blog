[The Phoenix Project: A Novel About IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186-the-phoenix-project) is an unusual book, its a novel that takes us to the Parts Unlimited fictional company which produces and sells its products. Its future is highly dependent on the IT project that should make the company catch up its competition in highly competitive market. The problem is - the project is massively over budget and very late.

## Main lessons and quotes:

- Software development process can be improved be observing and learning from industrial processess in factories. The problems that factories face during production may be similar.
- The least effective way of working is by putting out fires. The key is to understand the problem, a flow of information and indentifying the limits in the process. Organizing the process in a way to prevent longterm breakdowns depends on that.
- There are 4 types of works: **Business projects**, **Internat IT projects**, **Changes**, **Unplanned work**
- "Improving daily work is even more important than doing daily work."
- “Goldratt taught us that in most plants, there are a very small number of resources, whether it’s men, machines, or materials, that dictates the output of the entire system. We call this the constraint or bottleneck.”
- "Any improvements made anywhere besides the bottleneck are an illusion"
- "Mike Rother says that it almost doesn’t matter what you improve, as long as you’re improving something. Why? Because if you are not improving, entropy guarantees that you are actually getting worse, which ensures that there is no path to zero errors, zero work-related accidents, and zero loss."
- "Technical debt’ that is not being paid down. It comes from taking shortcuts, which may make sense in the short-term. But like financial debt, the compounding interest costs grow over time. If an organization doesn’t pay down its technical debt, every calorie in the organization can be spent just paying interest, in the form of unplanned work."
- "We need to create a culture that reinforces the value of taking risks and learning from failure and the need for repetition and practice to create mastery."
